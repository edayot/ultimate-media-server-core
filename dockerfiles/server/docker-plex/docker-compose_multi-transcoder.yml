# Docker Plex Media Server Configuration File (with multiple docker containers for transcoding)
#
# There's various comments through this file, however the only things you should need to change to get going with minimal config is:
#    - <IP-OF-HOST-OR-DNS-FQDN-OF-HOST> (should become the actual external IP OR DNS Name of your server running the plex transcoder(s))
#    - /nas & /nas2 should be changed to real volumes where your media is.
